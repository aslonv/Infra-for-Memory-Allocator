# Infra For Memory Allocator

Starting off with advanced pointer usage and memory management concepts. 

## Features (to be continued...)

- Custom memory allocation (`my_malloc`)
- Custom memory deallocation (`my_free`)
- Memory layout visualization

## Building the Project

To build the project, simply run:

make

This will compile the allocator and create an executable named `allocator`

## Running the Project

After building, you can run the allocator with:

./allocator

This will run a series of allocation and deallocation operations and print the memory layout at each step.
